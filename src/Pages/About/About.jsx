        <Typography variant='p' sx={pStyles} gutterBottom paragraph>After using CRA [create react app] for a while, I ran into a problem with pollyfilling in webpack and it made me realise how little I knew about building react applications, in order to build my comprenesion I thought it'd be a good idea to mess around with Vite.</Typography>

        <Typography variant='h3' sx={{marginTop: '1em', fontWeight: '500'}} gutterBottom>What is Vite?</Typography>
        <Typography variant='p' sx={pStyles}>Vite, which was created by Evan You, the creator of the Vue.js framework, is next-generation frontend tooling that provides a blazing-fast dev server, bundling and a great developer experience. When I say fast, I mean itâ€”as start-up times can decrease tenfold in comparison to other tools, such as webpack, Rollup or Parcel.</Typography>
